I thought I was cool...
A person with presence
A hand-written letter
A relative I never quite got
I used to collect...
A miracle
He/she has really made a difference in my life
A religious experience
A childhood hero
Brand new pencil case
I just loved those shoes
There was music in the distance
A big decision
A new school bag
He/she stuck out from the crowd
Meeting up with a good friend
The smell of freshly baked bread
My favourite teddy
An angry face
A sharp knife
A goodbye I'll always remember
A fascinating relative
Imagine a place like that actually existing
A real gentleman/lady
A sporting event
A huge crowd
A special atmosphere
In the classroom
I would not have believed I could do that
I was really proud
There were lots of children
They were really political
That scared me
A neighbour
A mentor
A shop I loved as a child
A scent from my childhood
My first concert
We were lost
The day I was moving
A fever
A pet
A baptism
On the dance floor
Encountering another faith
We were a good team
I forgot all about time
An inexplicable occurrence
My new style
I was up on the stage
A special place at school
An instrument I once played
An invisible friend
A helping hand
A bicycle crash
That's a voice I'll never forget
At an exam
A part-time job
One boss I won't forget
The first day of school
A ritual I took part in
A scar
She/he just wan't like the rest of us
A gift that took me by surprise
I was new there
A celebration
They lived in their own special way
A little drama last week
A little thing that made me happy yesterday
A new hairstyle
There were Legos everywhere
Suddenly I felt very shy
A heroic deed
I saw a new side of a person this week
On the other side of the street
The place was a mess
A very old person
A musical experience that moved me
When I learned to swim
A brand new bike 
That city changed me
That film made a real impression
A visitor who made an impression
A long walk
Skiing
I saw the joy they felt
A book that affected me as a child
I had butterflies in my tummy
It was a real revelation
All alone in the city
I fell and hurt myself
A teacher I'll never forget
The car was full
The atmosphere that morning
I felt so welcome
A different family
A stairway
An early memory
A real eye-opener
