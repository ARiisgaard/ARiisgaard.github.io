A big decision
There was music in the distance
I just loved those shoes
The atmosphere that morning…
I felt so welcome
A different sort of family
A stairway
An early memory
A real eye-opener
The car was full
A teacher I’ll never forget
I fell and hurt myself
All alone in the city
It was a real revelation
I had butterflies in my tummy
A book that affected me as a child
I saw the joy the felt
Skiing
A long walk
A visitor who made an impression
That film made a real impression
That city changed me
A childhood hero
A religious experience
A brand new bicycle
When I learned to swim
A musical experience that moved me
A very old person
The place was a mess
On the other side of the street
I saw a new side of a person this week
A heroic deed
Suddenly I felt very shy
There were Legos everywhere
A new hairstyle
A little thing that made me happy yesterday
A little drama last week
They lived in their own special way
A celebration
I was new there
A gift that took me by surprise
She/he just wasn’t like the rest of us
A scar
A ritual I took part in
The first day of school
One boss I won’t forget
A part-time job
At an exam
A baptism
On the dance floor
A mentor
That scared me
A neighbour
An instrument I once played
A relative I never quite got
A hand-written letter
A special atmosphere
In the classroom
I would not have believed I could do that
Encountering another faith
An invisible friend
A helping hand
A bicycle crash
That’s a voice I’ll never forget
They were really political
I thought I was cool…
I dressed up as…
A person with a presence
We were a good team
An angry face
My favourite teddy
A goodbye I’ll always remember
Meeting up with a good friend
He/she stuck out from the crowd
A new school bag
