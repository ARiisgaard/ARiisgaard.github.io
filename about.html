									<h1>About</h1>

                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/mig3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>What initially piqued my interest in
programming was a creative urge.
Since I developed my first interactive
map, I have always found it hugely
satisfying to see oneâ€™s product
gradually gain more and more
features.</p>
<p>
This creative urge means that I am
constantly looking for new challenges
and love to play with new
technologies. How I approach these
challenges depends on the work
environment I sit in. I can easily focus
independently on a task, but my
experience is that development goes
faster in close collaboration with
others. I am also a big supporter of
interaction with the client that I
develop for. Here my less technical
bachelor is useful, as this provides a
broad interdisciplinary understanding
and has made me an experienced
interviewer.</p>
<p>Personally, I am outgoing,
hardworking and proactive. In my free
time I like to sit and nerd with small
technical optimizations of my
everyday life, such as a assistant tool
for project writing or an alarm app
which can sense if you have left the
room. However, I am also socially
inclined in my free time, where I do
improv theater weekly, host board
game evenings or other cozy events.
In both my professional and social
life, I am always looking for new
experiences.</p>
